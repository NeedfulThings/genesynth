# Genesynth

**Genesynth** is a music synthesizer module based around the Yamaha YM2612 FM Synthesis Chip, the same chip used in the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive.

## Why?

Because I wanted to. :)

## How?

This project is designed to use the Teensy 3.5 to control the YM2612 via USB MIDI.

More details for the hardware is available under the hardware folder, and more details on the firmware is under the firmware folder.
